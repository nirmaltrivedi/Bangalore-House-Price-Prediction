This data science project is a real estate project made to predict the house prices in Bangalore. 

We have used python and its libraries to make this code run. During the model building, we did multiple things such as data cleaning, visualization, outlier detection using business logic and by measuring skewness, feature engineering, dimensionality detection, gridsearch CV for hyperparameter tuning and used various regression algorithms. Here we have used the Bangalore House pricing dataset from Kaggle. The following are the tools and libraries we used to build this model:

1. Python language
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook
